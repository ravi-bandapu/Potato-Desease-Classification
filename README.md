🥔 Potato Disease Classification using CNN
📌 Overview

This project is a Deep Learning-based web application that classifies potato leaf images into Healthy or Diseased.
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras and deployed via Flask API.

⚡ Goal: Help farmers detect potato leaf diseases early, reducing crop losses and manual inspection effort.

🚀 Features

Upload a potato leaf image and get instant prediction.

CNN model trained with 95% accuracy on test data.

Data augmentation for robust training.

REST API built with Flask for easy integration.

Extendable to other crops in the future.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)

Flask (for API backend)

HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (for simple frontend)

Dataset: PlantVillage (Potato Leaf Dataset from Kaggle)



📊 Results

Training Accuracy: ~97%

Test Accuracy: ~95%

Model successfully distinguishes between healthy and diseased leaves.

(You can add a confusion matrix or accuracy/loss curve image here for extra impact.)

🔮 Future Improvements

Extend classification to other crops (tomato, maize, etc.).

Deploy app on Heroku / AWS / GCP.

Create a mobile app version for farmers.

Integrate with IoT devices for automated disease detection in fields.
